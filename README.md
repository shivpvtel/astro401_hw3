Patel_hw3.ipynb = The python file implementing the all Codes, Algorithms and data fitting models in python.

Figure_1.png = The output plot for the Lagrange Interpolation of the Runge Function.
Figure_2.png = The output plot for the Langrange Interpolation of the Runge Function with n=6,8,10.
Figure_3.png = The output plot for the Cubic Spline Interpolation of the Runge Function over top figure 1.2.
Figure_4.png = The output plot for the Composite Trapezoidal Rule and Simpson's Composite Rule with the Intergral Value.
Figure_5.png = The output plot for the Composite Trapezoidal Rule and Simpson's Composite Rule with the Error of Integral Value.


All data was coded and compiled primarily using Jupyter Notebook, a little of VScode, as well as the Mac terminal.
